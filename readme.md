# Guest Greeter

## Instructions
- You need Node (say that five times fast), and NPM. Then, `npm install`
- Run the tests: `npm test`
- Use the CLI: `npm run greet`

### Note: This is located in a private gitlab repo that I'd be happy to grant individual access to if you send me any usernames (cgives@me.com).

## Design
Even if this mess of a submission doesn't get me a job, I am very happy to have done it. Creating a command line app with prompts was new to me, and I forced myself to stick with the unit testing-- two really important skills. The code attempts to be non-repetitive but not too 'clever'. I know that I could rebuild it to be better, now, but this is the first attempt.

## Language
Despite learning Java pretty recently and talking to you folks about it, I am using Node.JS for this app. Java may have been a better choice, but I was ready to go with Node, having done a little unit testing with Mocha/Chai.js with Node in the past.

## Tests
The goal for this project was to use BDD practices. The 'pending' tests you see serve as something of a wishlist for the app-- the things that there wasn't time for. Before writing any functions, I at least had a pending test for it. The idea is to make the app pretty easy to understand if somebody wants to pick it up and work on it, and difficult to break (without noticing).

## Wishlist for this app
Aside from the pending tests 'wishlist', the app could be infinitely upgraded and improved. For one thing, the way the functions work is pretty spaghetti-like, and I wish it were simpler. I'd love to give this thing a UI -- I would have fun doing that.
